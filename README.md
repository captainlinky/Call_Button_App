This application is intended to replace nursing a nursing home call button via the patients cell phone. The application is installed on the "nursing station" which is a PC that is where ever you commonly sit during your day, the Nursing station
will start listening on http://{NURSINGSTATIONIPADDRESS}:5000 and will become immediately accessible to any device on your LAN/WLAN via web browser provided there are no firewalls between the wifi network and where the PC sits.
On the cell phone/tablet you can save as a shortcut on their application home screen and it will open up in a mobile friendly manner. There are 4 buttons categorizing what the patient call is for. Urine, bowel movements, food or drink, general call.
The data from the button pushes is tagged and added into event_log.csv. The events can be visualized on http://{NURSINGSTATIONIPADDRESS}:5000/trend or by clicking the unofficial 5th button at the top of the main screen of the App. 

Please note this application is for 1:1 care. The intended market are caretakers taking in their loved ones and want to track the frequency and types of care that are required, which is useful for figuring out schedules or when in home care staff need information for diagnostics of a health issue.
