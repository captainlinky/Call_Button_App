# Minimal requirements for running app.py
# These are the libraries imported and used by the application.
# To produce an exact, reproducible set of pinned versions, activate your
# virtualenv and run: pip freeze > requirements.txt

Flask==3.1.2
pandas>=2.0
matplotlib>=3.7
numpy>=1.24
python-dateutil>=2.8

# Optional (deployment)
# gunicorn

# Notes:

#     pip freeze > requirements.txt
# - The sound playback uses system utilities (paplay/mpg123) not Python packages.
